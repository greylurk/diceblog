      <description>&lt;p&gt;President&amp;rsquo;s day weekend in Minnesota means it&amp;rsquo;s time again for Con of the North!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got in a little late to Con of the North, meaning I just slid in to the 6pm Friday Call of Cthulhu game that I was running. The players were glad to see that there was &lt;em&gt;indeed&lt;/em&gt; a GM for the game, so I set about getting the game going before someone pulled a fire alarm. After that, we progressed through the adventure reasonably quickly, and it ended with the PCs figuring out what the monster was, and how to defeat it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought about slipping in to another game after mine ended at 10pm, knowing that my wife would be busy with stuff until 2am, but I ended up just sitting and watching the last half of another DM running the same adventure in CoC as I had just wrapped up. It was fun watching how the other GM handled the stuff I had literally just finished running PCs through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that game ended at midnight, I went back to my room, chilled out a bit, and double checked my prep for the Call of Cthulhu game I was planning on running the next day at 10am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning I got up and went down to check out the dealers room before my game.  I played a demo of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.warehouse23.com/products/lost-in-rlyeh&#34;&gt;Lost in R&amp;rsquo;Lyeh&lt;/a&gt; at the Atlas Games booth, and was satisfied enough with it that I picked up a copy.  I also got a chance to look at the absolutely beautiful physical copy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://unknown-armies-third-edition-roleplaying-game.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders/47510&#34;&gt;Unknown Armies 3rd Edition&lt;/a&gt; that they had there. I tried to get in to a Paranoia game, and an Unknown Armies demo, but things didn&amp;rsquo;t work out. I swung by the front desk to pick up some alternate tickets for some games, and then it was off to run my game. Things went pretty well, and I got some schwag from Chaosium to hand out to players, including a copy of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chaosium.com/s-petersens-field-guide-to-lovecraftian-horrors-pdf/&#34;&gt;S. Petersen&amp;rsquo;s Field Guide to Lovecraftian Horrors&lt;/a&gt; that I was loath to part with, but was able to hand off to a player that did a great job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my game, I met up with my Wife again, ate dinner, and then headed off to a game of [Everyone Is John][everyone-is-john] Celebrity Edition. We played through two rounds, where I got to be Johnny Bravo, seeking a date, and John Lenin, trying to get people to give peace a chance. The GM for the session had a whole lot of Johns printed up ahead of time, which made the game pretty fun and easy to play. It probably would have been a bit more fun if I had been drinking more, but what isn&amp;rsquo;t right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, I decided to try out the &amp;ldquo;Tékumel&amp;rdquo; track, with John Till&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Gate to Hmakuyal&amp;rdquo;. The game was pretty fun, with an even mix of people who had never played Tékumel before, and this was probably a good game to start with, since the characters were all outsiders to Tékumel (albeit, Aztec outsiders from an alternate Earth) who had discovered a gateway into Tékumel.  It was interesting to see some of the details of what has been referred to as &amp;ldquo;The First RPG Campaign Setting&amp;rdquo;. In a world where &amp;ldquo;western&amp;rdquo; fantasy dominates the RPG market, one of the earliest RPGs out there was set in a decisively non-western setting, with science-fantasy and completely different tropes than we&amp;rsquo;re used to. Another fun bit about this game was that it was done using a hack of the &amp;ldquo;Fate Freeport Companion&amp;rdquo; rules, which is actually the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve had a chance to try out the Fate rules. It worked out reasonably well, though we didn&amp;rsquo;t give the system a good chance to stretch its legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was one last pass through the dealer room, pick up a few deeply discounted board games that we had been eyeing, and back home again.  I had a great time at several of the games I played and ran, and I&amp;rsquo;m definitely looking forward to it again next year.&lt;/p&gt;
