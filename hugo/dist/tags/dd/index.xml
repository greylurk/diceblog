      <description>&lt;p&gt;The party restrained the Duergar and Svirfneblin who were battling in the middle of town, and headed off to the Svirfneblin encampment.  They were able to defeat the 4 Duergar who were attacking the door quick enough that the other 8 decided to head back to the Duergar encampment to regroup and re-enforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After speaking with the Svirfneblin, and checking out the warehouse very briefly, the PCs moved their army to the gnomish fungus garden, and helped gather and cremate the dead gnomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Toren (currently polymorphed into a Quetzocoatlus) and Ciella set off for the Zhentarim warehouse. The two of them spotted a statue in an alcove overlooking the garden, before checking the Pavillion that was erected in the center of the garden.  They found a gathering of Drow inside, preparing to negotiate with the Zhentarim. The Drow mage seemed offended at the fact that the PCs were obviously not the full Zhent negotiating contingent, and ordered them to leave. Not willing to make a fight out of it, they did go and speak with the Zhentarims. Ghazred and Luskar were preparing to speak with the Drow.  When they had the statue in the alcove pointed out to them, they said they didn&amp;rsquo;t know what was up with it, so Toren flew up to check it out, at which point it flew away (surprise, it was a Gargoyle!).  They chased it in an aerial battle to the center of town, where a quick battle took it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon returning to the Zhentarim alcove, they discovered that when Luskar and Ghazred went to speak with the Drow, Luskar was asaulted by one of the Drow &amp;ldquo;bodyguards&amp;rdquo; who has since fled.  Calming down the two groups, they vowed to investigate this attempted assasination. The rest of the party joined them, and Kendal was able to track the assassin to a warehouse just outside the Duergar encampment.  Listening inside, they heard some crazy muttering from someone inside, and concluded that the assassin must have been touched by some form of madness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blocking off all entrances, they were able to quickly sneak up on the would be assassin, and capture her. They found a fist sized opal in her pouch, and Ciella pocketed the gemstone (and picked up an indefinite madness for his efforts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dragging the would be assassin back to the Zhentarim encampment, the party threw her into an unused storage shed, and questioned her with help from Luskar&amp;rsquo;s charm eye.  THey discovered that she was given a message in the form of an opal from Menzoberranzan as orderts to kill Luskar, or at least that&amp;rsquo;s how she interpreted it. Meanwhile, the Gargoyle they had previously knocked out had awoken, and started wailing in sorrow in the next shed over where he was restrained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewing him, they discovered that he had taken the Gem from a Gnome, and had given it to the Drow assassin as proof of his true love for her. Cue soap-opera dramatics, and some piteous wailing on the behalf of the Gargoyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving punishment of the Drow to Luskan the party convened on what to do with the Gem, that they&amp;rsquo;d now determined was a powerful demon trap, and was almost certainly &amp;ldquo;full&amp;rdquo; of a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; powerful demon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Ciella decided to just destroy the gem, which freed Fraz-url-ab into the Abyss.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>12 Minor magical items</title>
      <link>https://diceblog.greylurk.com/post/minor-magical-items/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I like handing out magical items that are &lt;em&gt;immensely&lt;/em&gt; useful in world to the average denizen of a fantasy world, but are basically useless to most PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#roofing-sealant&#34;&gt;Roofing Sealant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#stone-of-warmth&#34;&gt;Stone of Warmth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#washing-tub&#34;&gt;Washing Tub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#everfull-canteen&#34;&gt;Everfull Canteen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#portable-clearing&#34;&gt;Portable Clearing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#animated-broom&#34;&gt;Animated Broom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#polishing-cloth&#34;&gt;Polishing Cloth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#shelf-of-preservation&#34;&gt;Shelf of Preservation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#mosquito-stone&#34;&gt;Mosquito Stone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#obedience-collar&#34;&gt;Collar of Obedience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#navigating-pebble&#34;&gt;Navigating Pebble&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-name-roofing-sealant-a-roofing-sealant&#34;&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;roofing-sealant&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Roofing Sealant&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;wondrous-item-uncommon&#34;&gt;Wondrous Item, uncommon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This item is a large pot of a foul-smelling alchemical mixture. If painted on to a surface, the mixture will cover about 1000 square feet, and will dry into a shiny, black surface that is entirely water-tight as long as it isn&amp;rsquo;t damaged.  Water, ice, and snow will just slide right off of it, no matter what the surface is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-name-stone-of-warmth-a-stone-of-warmth&#34;&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;stone-of-warmth&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Stone of Warmth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;wondrous-item-common&#34;&gt;Wondrous Item, common&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This item is simply a stone which is constantly warm to the touch.  While wearing this stone aginst your skin, you&amp;rsquo;re immune to environmental cold effects down to freezing.  Additonally, if you place this stone in a pot full of water (up to one gallon), the water will slowly boil, allowing you to make a fine soup or stew without lighting a fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-name-washing-tub-a-washing-tub&#34;&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;washing-tub&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Washing Tub&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;wondrous-item-common-1&#34;&gt;Wondrous Item, common&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This item looks to be a simple wooden tub, just like the dozens of washing tubs found around the well in any small village. However, when a load of clothes are placed in this tub, and it is filled with water, the tub&amp;rsquo;s magic takes over, adding soap, and cleaning the clothes itself, with no outside action.  Within 10 miutes, the clothes are perfectly clean, and any small tears are repaired. The tub does not, however, dry the clothes, so they must be hung up to dry as normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-name-everfull-canteen-a-everfull-canteen&#34;&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;everfull-canteen&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Everfull Canteen&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;wondrous-item-common-2&#34;&gt;Wondrous Item, common&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This appears to be a nicely constructed, though otherwise unremarkable leather canteen with a wooden stopper and spout.  It holds about one quart of water, and weighs about 3 lbs when full. If the canteen is even partly empty, and the stopper is replaced into the spout, five minutes later the canteen will be filled up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-name-portable-clearing-a-portable-clearing&#34;&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;portable-clearing&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Portable Clearing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;wondrous-item-uncommon-1&#34;&gt;Wondrous Item, uncommon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When folded up, this appears to be simply a bolt of brown and green fabric. If the portable clearing is unrolled and unfolded in any wooded area, it will create a clearing with a radius of 40&amp;rsquo;. This clearing is flat, free of obstacles, and dry, regardless of how densely forested, uneven, and damp the area it&amp;rsquo;s in. When the clearing is rolled back up again, the terrain returns to its previous state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-name-animated-broom-a-animated-broom&#34;&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;animated-broom&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Animated Broom&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;wondrous-item-uncommon-2&#34;&gt;Wondrous Item, uncommon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This average looking broom is likely the byproduct of a very bored apprentice.  When its bristles are tapped to the floor, the broom animates itself and quickly sweeps the floor in the room it&amp;rsquo;s currently standing in.  Within a minute per 10ft square, all of the dirt and dust on the floor of this room will be brushed into one large pile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-name-polishing-cloth-a-polishing-cloth&#34;&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;polishing-cloth&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Polishing Cloth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;wondrous-item-common-3&#34;&gt;Wondrous Item, Common&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a small piece of soft cloth (approximately 1&amp;rsquo; square) which, when rubbed vigorously against any smooth surface will create an almost mirror-like shine on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-name-shelf-of-preservation-a-shelf-of-preservation&#34;&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;shelf-of-preservation&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Shelf of Preservation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;wondrous-item-common-4&#34;&gt;Wondrous Item, Common&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 8&amp;rsquo; by 4&amp;rsquo; shelf is not easily portable, however any food placed on the shelf enters a sort of stasis, keeping the food fresh and edible pretty much indefinitely.  These are easily identified in ancient dungeons by the fresh vegetables and meat sitting out openly on the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-name-mosquito-stone-a-mosquito-stone&#34;&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;mosquito-stone&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Mosquito Stone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;wondrous-item-uncommon-3&#34;&gt;Wondrous Item, uncommon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mosquito stone is a small pebble, polished through years of use, which smells faintly of oranges.  When carried on a person, no insects of &amp;ldquo;tiny&amp;rdquo; or smaller size can approach within 5&amp;rsquo; of the stone&amp;rsquo;s bearer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-name-obedience-collar-a-collar-of-obedience&#34;&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;obedience-collar&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Collar of Obedience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;wondrous-item-common-5&#34;&gt;Wondrous Item, common&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leather collar attaches easily to the end of a pole.  When slipped over the neck of a wild canine, the canine immediately becomes as docile as the average domestic dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-name-navigating-pebble-a-navigating-pebble&#34;&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;navigating-pebble&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Navigating Pebble&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;wondrous-item-common-6&#34;&gt;Wondrous Item, common&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this pebble is placed on a relatively flat surface, it will skip, hop, roll, and skitter towards the north side of the surface, stopping as soon as it meets any sort of obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://diceblog.greylurk.com/post/out-of-the-abyss-feb-13-2017/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2017 08:05:42 -0600</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Notes from the Feb. 13, 2017 D&amp;amp;D session&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picking up from &lt;a href=&#34;https://diceblog.greylurk.com/post/out-of-the-abyss-jan-29-2016&#34;&gt;last session&lt;/a&gt; the PCs were venturing into a Goblin holdout in the underdark. I had a chance in between games to prep this a bit, so I picked a few chewy nuggets of inspriation from a goblin-based adventure from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://patreon.com/ensider&#34;&gt;En5ider&lt;/a&gt; magazine that EnWorld puts out. Oooh, and Nilbogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the first point for the game to pick up was Eric Tealeaf sneaking into the Goblin cavern just before the guards were able to roll a stone blocking the entrance. He stealthily followed the two goblin guards down the hallway into a large room filled with low workbenches, where a team of 10 goblins were working on a task. As the alarm was raised, the goblins split into two groups, 5 heading off to the right, and 7 heading off to the left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric started investigating the tables while waiting for the other PCs to move the stone and enter the cavern system. Since the goblins have darkvision, the cavern system was dark. He noticed that it appeared that the workshop tables were covered entirely in little stone spheres in various stages of carving and polishing. After the other characters arrive, Eric suggests they follow the bulk of the goblins towards the left. Kendal does some tracking, and discovers that at least one set of foot prints is walking backwards everywhere it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a short period, they come across a fun little trap from the old &amp;ldquo;Grimtooths&amp;rdquo;: A curtain wired to drop a bunch of marbles behind them, causing them to slip and slide forward into a pit. Nothing seriously damaging, but enough to frustrate them and put them on guard for future traps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came a corridor which had a wooden floor instead of the stone which had been prevalent up until now.  The wood floor continued on, around a corner, and to a set of stairs heading up.  Now on guard, Eric Tealeaf examined the steps closely, and discovered that the 4th step up was a trigger of some sort.  Not wanting to bother with the trap, he simply told everyone to step over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They arrived at a large chamber, with a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; high ceiling (100 feet at least.  As they were examinging the room, they were attacked by a Xorn which was hanging from the ceiling, to get the drop on them. The xorn wasn&amp;rsquo;t a huge challenge, but they were starting to wonder what the heck was going on here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Xorn room was a dead end, so they back-tracked to the steps.  Curious, and testing a theory, Tealeaf stood at the top of the steps and threw rocks down at the 4th step up. He connected, and the whole staircase swung down, revealing another tunnel underneat this tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party progressed forward, checking for more traps as they went on.  Eventually, they discovered a room with a large sleigh in it, resting in the middle of a room, atop a circle with a mosaic tile. Four goblins are here, fitting up harnesses of some sort to the sleigh. A fight ensues, and one of the goblins leaps down onto the mosaic, and shouts &amp;ldquo;up!&amp;rdquo; and the whole assembly starts rising.  The PCs knock him out quickly, but the disc keeps rising.  There&amp;rsquo;s a few tense moments as the disc nearly crushes the sleigh, and the people on it, but eventually they realize they merely have to issue mental commands to the disc to stop it from moving vertically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They progress onwards, and discover a Cockatrice pen, where there is a stone goblin, frozen where he was when the Cockatrices attacked him.  They dispatch the cockatrices, and realize they&amp;rsquo;re still short a goblin. Doubling back, they realize that if they lift up the stairs, they&amp;rsquo;ll be able to contiue on to a tunnel ahead. And there they encounter another goblin (armed with some sort of alchemical poison), and the Nilbog in a fur-lined crushed red velvet suit. They test the poison on the goblin guard, and it makes him blow up like a balloon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally they dispatch them both, and finish clearing out the dungeon, with the new floating disc and three more vials of the goblin poison as treasure, alongside a few hundred gold worth of gems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few more days of travel, they finally arrive at Mantol Derith. Approaching silently, they are worried about the eerie silence in the marketplace, and sounds of battle from the fringes of the cave. They quickly knock out both the Svirfneblin and the Duregar that are fighting in the middle of town, and are planning on questioning them as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://diceblog.greylurk.com/post/out-of-the-abyss-jan-29-2016/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2017 16:45:21 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://diceblog.greylurk.com/post/out-of-the-abyss-jan-29-2016/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Notes from the Jan. 29, 2016 D&amp;amp;D session&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started off with a bit of bookeeping in Gauntlgrym, where the PCs decided they
needed to speak with Trevion Stonechalk, a dwarf working for the Granitespike
family who had contact with Jaezred and owes him some money. Trevion gave them
some details on Gravenhollow, namely that they should speak with the Stone
Giants to find the route there.  He said that he had held the Kybere in his
hands, and knew that it was evil. It was being taken to Gravenhollow for
safe keeping, and he didn&amp;rsquo;t think that Jaezred should have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After speaking with Trevion, a few other folks purchased some stuff. Corlin
bought a kit of vials and chemicals to preserve various bits and pieces that he
was planning to retrieve from defeated enemies. Troy&amp;rsquo;s character bought a wagon with a cage on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then they set off.  The route to Mantol Derith starts off with 6 days of
overland transport, which progresses uneventfully.  During that time however,
[Marc&amp;rsquo;s Character]&amp;rsquo;s Basilisk egg hatches, so he starts to lag behind the
party. On the 6th day, they reach the secret Zhentarim entry to the underdark,
and give the password to get in. They&amp;rsquo;re warned that about a day&amp;rsquo;s worth of
travel in is well patrolled, but any farther than that they&amp;rsquo;ll be on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about 3 days of travel, they find a relatively nice cavern to set up camp
but pretty briefly, someone notices a drow warning sign scribed into the wall.
Exploring the back of the cavern, they discovered a small passageway that led
into a dark cavern, crowded with stalactites and stalagmites. Within a few
dozen feet, the party was attacked by a group of Shadow Demons. The Shadow
Demons were quickly dispatched by the Paladin and the cleric of Light, though
two of them did manage to escape. After continuing into the cavern, they
discovered Bruthwahl Firehands - a Duregar driven mad by Orcus. He had a set of
human corpses he was experimenting on (for loose meanings of the word
&amp;ldquo;experimenting&amp;rdquo;), and a pair of Drow corpses in a cavern towards the back.
Kendal ultimately executed Bruthwahl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few more days of travel, there&amp;rsquo;s a deep chasm (~300ft deep, ~300 feet wide)
with a broken bridge across it. While the PCs could cross it with their riding
lizards, the wagon and the faction troops necessitate using a trail down into
the chasm. At the base of it, Troy&amp;rsquo;s character noticed a noise to the side, and
went off to chase it. A few other characters surrounded the disturbance, and
discovered that it was a trio of escaped Shield Dwarves who had been slaves of
the Drow: Bori, Kinlan, and Firi Flintnose. After some hemming and hawing about
whether it was safe to trust the dwarves with the password to return to the
surface through the Zhentarim stronghold, the PCs eventually convinced the
three dwarves to join them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, about 10 days out from Mantol Derith, the PCs were treated to finding a good location to hole up, A cavern with a natural pair of defense platforms on either side of it, flanking a very tight bottleneck entry to another deeper cavern. However, as they approached it, they discovered that not only was it easily defensible, but it was actually defended by some goblins. The PCs decided to attempt to assault the fortifications, and Tealeaf slinked through the door as the rest of the party was arming up.  The Goblins rolled a stone across the entry way, just after Tealeaf entered, and game was called then.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Notes from the Jan. 15, 2016 D&amp;amp;D session&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game picked up with Uthgar and Kendal negotiating with Autie Bertha to keep Uthgar&amp;rsquo;s home intact. Bertha&amp;rsquo;s gout is temporarily alleviated by Kendal&amp;rsquo;s magics, but she&amp;rsquo;s still getting old and is looking for a way to retire and support herself. Uthgar offers to let her stay at his house, so she can sell her own house, and live off of the profits, with the caveat that she not molest/touch Grandfather Thornbeard&amp;rsquo;s beard, which is preserved in state on the wall of the house. She agrees, and the party returns to the apartment they&amp;rsquo;ve been allocated for thier visit. Kreve is passed out on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corlin and Marc&amp;rsquo;s Character went off to search for good stuff outside the city.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Taking the Initiative</title>
      <link>https://diceblog.greylurk.com/post/initiative/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2017 22:35:28 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://diceblog.greylurk.com/post/initiative/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my least favorite aspects of D&amp;amp;D is what I call the &amp;ldquo;Conga Line of Death&amp;rdquo; initiative system.  At the beginning of the combat (or turn in earlier editions), you figure out what order everyone is going to act in, and then no matter what happens &amp;ldquo;mid round&amp;rdquo;, the characters proceed to act one after the other in the order established previously, like dancers in a conga line.  This is easy for the DM to track, as they can just have an ordered list like a baseball lineup, calling each &amp;lsquo;hitter&amp;rsquo; up to bat in order. But there are a few big problems with it. First off, it&amp;rsquo;s boring. We know that Bob is going to act after the goblin each turn, no matter whether the goblin is doing something quick or not. Secondly, it leads to bizarre tactical decisions among the PCs (and NPCs) based on the known order of operations. You get situations where the PCs &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that they can optimize healing by positioning the cleric last in the initiative, etc. Third, due to the circular nature of rounds, having a high initiative only matters the first round. After the first round, PCs with high initiatives just act in order, just like everyone else.  They&amp;rsquo;re stuck in the same deathly conga line as the slow initiative people, who ironically get to act right before they do. Finally, the whole system creates these weird situations where the PCs start combat by firing arrows at the wary enemies, but because the enemies rolled high on initiative, the PCs don&amp;rsquo;t get to fire their arrows until all of the bad guys have acted!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve these problems, I&amp;rsquo;ve been throwing around a few ideas. The current system that I&amp;rsquo;m playtesting with my regular 5e group is what I&amp;rsquo;m calling &amp;ldquo;taking the initiative&amp;rdquo;. Basically, whoever &amp;ldquo;starts&amp;rdquo; combat with their action gets to go first by default. Anyone who wants to interrupt them can &amp;ldquo;take the initiative&amp;rdquo; from them by rolling an initiative check against the person who &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; the intitiative&amp;rsquo;s static initiative.  So, for example, Bob declares he is firing an arrow at Orky McOrkerson.  Orky has an initiative modifier of +2, and Bob has an initiative modifier of +6.  Orky decides to try to take the initiative, and must make an initiative check at DC 16 in order to act before Bob.  He rolls a 17, +2 is 19, so he&amp;rsquo;s taken the initiative! Orky scrambles for cover behind a rock, and returns fire. Bob is stymied temporarily. After you act, you choose an enemy to pass initiative to, and play continues back and forth between the two sides until you run out of enemies who haven&amp;rsquo;t acted yet this round, in which case you pass it to an ally who hasn&amp;rsquo;t acted this round. If you&amp;rsquo;re out of enemies and allies, then the round resets.  This interacts just fine with the &amp;ldquo;reaction&amp;rdquo; mechanic in 5e, and people can still use their reactions to interrupt enemy actions for free, without needing to take the initiative. Tracking rounds is done quite easily with the same sorts of mechanisms as you&amp;rsquo;d use for standard initiative. You have a whiteboard with the combatants listed on it, and just put a check mark next to each of them when they act in the round.  Once they&amp;rsquo;ve all got checkmarks, erase the checkmarks and start again.  If you&amp;rsquo;re using &amp;ldquo;screen hangers&amp;rdquo; to track initiative, just have all the people who have already acted over on the left side, and those who haven&amp;rsquo;t on the right. Once they&amp;rsquo;ve acted, just move them all over the right and start again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this makes combat a lot more dynamic and interesting, instead of the static, boring initiative system that&amp;rsquo;s been &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; for most of D&amp;amp;D and Pathfinders&amp;rsquo; life.&lt;/p&gt;
