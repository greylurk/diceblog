Notable Locations
---

### Creighton Mine

An old, closed down Iron Mine. The lower tunnels were flooded, and geological surveys have shown that the area isn't rich enough in iron to warrant a more extensive mining effort. Preserved by the local mining historical society and open for tours in the summer.

* **Natalee Kleist**: Mark’s Wife, Head of the Creighton Mine Society

### Bartlett Lake 

Near the mine, Many houses in the city border it.  The rest of the perimiter is dotted with cabins owned by "city folk" from Duluth and the Twin Cities, as well as a few farms.

* **Joel Stahlberger**: Pig farmer whose land borders the lake
* **Connie Stahlberger**: Joel's wife, beekeeper
* **Noah Kleist**: Son of Mark and Natalee, handyman and caretaker for several of the cabins along the lake. 

### Riverside

At the south side of Bartlett lake, threre is a dam that used to be used to power the old paper mill, and it empties into Bartlett River. All of the folks from town just refer to the little parking lot at the base of the dam as "The Riverside". During the summer, there's a local farmer's market that pops up there on the weekends, and there's a small city park with a playground nearby as well.

### The Overpass

Downtown Creighton is south of State Highway 177, but the town is effectively cut in half by the highway. Back in the 90's there was a series of accidents on Main Street where it crossed 177, so MNDOT built an overpass.
