# 1d4 Rocs

{{% fluid_img src="/post/random-roc-encounters/Rocweb.jpg" class="float-right" %}}

Here's a few options on how to flesh out the 1d4 Rocs from my
[Random Mountain Encounters](random-mountain-encounters.html).

## 1) Recent Kill

The characters are passing along a trail below a cliff, when a whole elk drops
onto the trail in front of them, glancing up, they see a huge Roc dropping from
the cliff overhead diving towards them to retrieve the kill that it dropped.
They have 1 round before the beast will be upon them,

## 2) A hunting pair

The characters are crossing an open stretch of rocks between one forested section
of mountain trail and the next. A sharp-eyed PC spots what looks to be one very
large bird nearby, and approaching. By the time they realize that it's actually
a *really* large bird that was far off, and closing on their position, they are
too far from either wooded section of trail to find cover there.

What the PCs don't realize is that atop a rocky outcropping just north of their
position is the nest that two Rocs share, and the male sitting on a pair of eggs
which have been laid only days ago. The Rocs have not yet spotted the PCs, but
they will do so quickly unless they can take some action. This pair will defend
their eggs, but are not currently hungry, having just returned from a hunt.

## 3) Learning to Fly

The party's morning routine is disrupted when several of the large trees at the
edge of camp crack and splinter, as a juvenile Roc lands roughly on them having
just left the nest for the first time. Her proud parents are following just
behind, and land on two other sides of camp. All three enormous birds eye the
characters, deciding whether flying is hungry enough work to justify the work
of devouring the PCs, or maybe just their horses.

## 4) The Abandoned Eyrie

Centuries ago, a group of frost giants kept an eyrie and raised Rocs for use in
battles against the Dragons. However, shifts in the ordning eventually
disgraced the family and forced them to move on from their mountain home. They
left the huge stone eyrie that they built to house their "pets" and simply
released the beasts into the wild.

In the centuries since, two families of Rocs have continued to occupy the
eyrie, while most of the buildings and structures on the mountaintop decayed
into ruin. Now, the only remaining structure is a stone building, with one
side open to the elements where ancient ironwood timbers serves as roosts for
the two mated pairs of Rocs who reside there. Each pair has their own separate
"nesting box" from which they cannot see eachother, which is fortunate
otherwise they would almost certainly kill eachother.

Exploring the ruins of the erie might reveal some treasures left behind by the
giants when they left the place, but who knows what else has taken up residence
in the giants' decaying root cellar.
