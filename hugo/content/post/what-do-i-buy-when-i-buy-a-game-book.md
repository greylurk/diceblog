I haunt a lot of Facebook, MeWe and G+ groups about roleplaying, catering
to people from first time DMs to 40 year veterans of the Edition Wars. I've
noticed that there's a lot of discussion around about just what we expect to
pay for when we buy Roleplaying Game books. I occasionally see remarks like
"If I'm going to pay $40 for a book, I don't want to have to do any work to
use it in my game," or "I don't care if it's got stats for my system, I'm
just going to tear it apart and use the ideas in it." Obviously these are
coming from gamemasters with two very different play and prep styles, and it
really depends on the the game. 

A lot of people divide roleplaying game supplements into two different 
categories: Crunch and Fluff. Crunch is shorthand for rules, statistics,
character creation options, and so forth. Fluff is the more "ephemeral" stuff, 
NPCs, plotlines, descriptions of locations, cities, factions, etc. Most books
are a blend of the two: A book might have 20 pages of new character options and
then 40 pages of discussion of NPCs that interact with characters who use those
character options.
