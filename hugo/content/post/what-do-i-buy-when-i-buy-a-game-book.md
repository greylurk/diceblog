I haunt a lot of Facebook, MeWe and G+ groups about roleplaying, catering
to people from first time DMs to 40 year veterans of the Edition Wars. I've
noticed that there's a lot of discussion around about just what we expect to
pay for when we buy Roleplaying Game books. I occasionally see remarks like
"If I'm going to pay $40 for a book, I don't want to have to do any work to
use it in my game," or "I don't care if it's got stats for my system, I'm
just going to tear it apart and use the ideas in it." Obviously these are
coming from gamemasters with two very different play and prep styles, and it
really depends on the the game.

A lot of people divide roleplaying game supplements into two different
categories: Crunch and Fluff. Crunch is shorthand for rules, statistics,
character creation options, and so forth. Fluff is the more "ephemeral" stuff,
NPCs, plotlines, descriptions of locations, cities, factions, etc. Most books
are a blend of the two: A book might have 20 pages of new character options and
then 40 pages of discussion of NPCs that interact with characters who use those
character options. Other books might be more mixed: a monster manual might have
120 pages of new monsters. The first 2 paragraphs of the monster might be rules
for a specific edition of the game, and the next 4 paragraphs might be just
story seeds and descriptions of the monsters. In general, crunch tends to be
very specific to a single game, and fluff can be easily translated to another
game in the same genre with very little effort.

Changing either the fluff or the crunch to adapt it to your game can be called
"reskinning". You might take the Star-Knight class for a Sci Fi Game and reskin
it to fit with your fantasy game, because you like their Laser Swords. Or you
might take the Lobster-men from the modern horror game, and re-skin it to fit
in with the rules-light story-based horror game that you're running a one shot
in. 

Almost every game book will require some amount of reskinning in order to use
it at your table. Even if you run a strictly canon Forgotten Realms campaign, 
your players actions are going to, in any non-trivial campaign, diverge from 
the pubished setting. The question is more one of degree. If you're buying a 
book published in a different rules system, but with some interesting "fluff" 
you want to use, you'll need to do quite a bit of work to translate the rules.
