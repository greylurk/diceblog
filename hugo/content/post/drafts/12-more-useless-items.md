## <a name="writing-desk"></a> Writing Desk
### Wondrous Item, rare
This desk, which is almost always found mounted and secured below decks in a ship, renders the person seated there immune to the pitching and rocking of the ship. No matter how rough the seas, the person sitting at this desk will feel as though they're sitting on a rock-solid level surface. Their handwriting will not be disrupted by the pitching of the decks, and the ink-pot they are using will not slide around, or off the table.

## <a name="slow-falling-glassware"></a> Slow Falling Glassware
### Wondrous Item, uncommon
Designed by a wizard with clumsy friends, the slow-falling glassware will not shatter against the floor when knocked off the table. Instead, these glasses will quickly right themselves, and then descend to the ground gently, and land upright, with no damage on the floor.
