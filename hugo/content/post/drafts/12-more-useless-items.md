## <a name="writing-desk"></a> Writing Desk
### Wondrous Item, common
This desk, which is almost always found mounted and secured below decks in a ship, renders the person seated there immune to the pitching and rocking of the ship. No matter how rough the seas, the person sitting at this desk will feel as though they're sitting on a rock-solid level surface. Their handwriting will not be disrupted by the pitching of the decks, and the ink-pot they are using will not slide around, or off the table.

## <a name="slow-falling-glassware"></a> Slow Falling Glassware
### Wondrous Item, common
Designed by a wizard with clumsy friends, the slow-falling glassware will not shatter against the floor when knocked off the table. Instead, these glasses will quickly right themselves, and then descend to the ground gently, and land upright, with no damage on the floor.

## <a name="house-seed"></a> House Seed
### Wondrous Item, common
A small, non-descript brown and grey seed, that when planted grows over the space of an hour into a small stone-and-wood constructed house. The house is very simple, but sturdy and measures about 20' by 30', with room for about 4 people to live comfortably in.

If the house is burned down, and the ground near the center of the building is dug up and searched, the seed can be found, and re-used in another place.

## <a name="fruit-root"></a> Fruit Root
### Wondrous Item, common
This woody chunk of a tree root can be planted easily in any loose soil and watered with about a gallon of water will grow overnight into a mature fruit tree, bearing 1d4 bushels of fruit within a day, regardless of season, climate or weather. The fruit tree will then fall in line with the local seasons, fruiting as is normal for it's breed, though it will continue growing as if it was in it's native climate, regardless of where it is actually located. There is at least one fertile lemon tree growing deep in the frozen tundra due to this magical item.

If the tree is chopped down, or burned, or otherwise destroyed, a section of the root can be dug up, and replanted as the original. Digging the root up takes a couple of hours with the correct tools (shovel, saws, etc.).

## <a name="quill-scribe"></a> Quill Scribe
### Wondrous Item, common
This item appears to be a rather nice-looking feather quill, with a silver nib. If the quill tip is dipped in ink and touched to a piece of paper, the quill will stand up perpendicular to the paper, and stand there until pulled away from the page. Until then, the quill will transcribe all words spoken near it onto the piece of paper.  When speaking, it is vital to be concise and exact, because the quill will transcribe literally every word, including punctuation and pauses. The result is frequently a salad of words that is laughable. The quill doesn't use any ink, it only needs ink to activate it. 

## <a name="book-of-lending"></a>Book of Lending
### Wondrous Item, common
When found, this book often appears to be simply a blank book, with a slight illusion enchantment attached to it. However, when touched against another book, and a command word is spoken, the book's pages become an exact copy of any non-magical text and artwork found in the other book. Additionally, the artwork and writing will vanish from the other book. However, the duplication effect only lasts until the next sun-up. After that the Book of Lending reverts to a blank book, and the copied book's text re-appears in it's original form. 

This can temporarily be used to "steal" a wizard's spell book temporarily, but you must act quickly to copy any spells out of the book of lending, since the text will return to it's primary owner in a matter of hours. 

## <a name=""></a>Athanor of Purity
### Wondrous Item, common
An athanor is a somewhat large wood-fired stove, designed to produce very even, very regular heat. They are frequently used in both bread-baking and
