Dungeons and Dragons has a very strange take on religion.

Historically people in the real world have typically followed either monotheistic religions where there is one and only one god deserving of worship, or polytheistic religions, where various different deities have various "zones of influence" or "domains".

While people might commonly take a specific deity as their "patron", and honor that deity above the others in the pantheon, they would still give honor and reverence to the other deities in the pantheon when the situation called for it. The Vestal Virgins in Rome were devoted to Vesta, but they made the *mola salsa* to be sprinkled on offerings to all of the gods. The Flamen Martialus, the high priest of Mars presided over a festival in honor of *Acca Larentia*.
