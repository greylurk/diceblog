# Secrets of Sokol Keep

This weekend I ran the Adventurer's League adventure "Secrets of Sokol Keep" at the local game shop, and had a good time with it.  Here's a few notes on the NPCs which might be helpful to other DMs running the adventure.

## In Phlan

The adventure opens in Phlan, where the dockworkers, and several locals are concerned that the Lighthouse that sits out on Thorn Island hasn't been lit for the last 2 nights.  This is costing the town merchants money, as various shipping concerns have avoided the harbor due to the treacherous sandbars near Phlan.

Locations within Phlan:

* The Laughing Goblin - This is a "lowlife" kind of tavern where the adventure opens. It is featured in several other Season 1 Adventures.
* Thorn Island - Thorn Island is largely composed of sand washed out into the Moonsea.  While it's generally stable, the island doesn't support much in the way of flora or fauna except for a small vegetable garden in the Sokol Keep courtyard, and a few hares and other vermin that persist despit Darvag's best efforts to eliminate them.
* Sokol Keep - This small castle was once a Temple to Tyr, but was leveled about 200 years ago, and rebuilt into a proper castle.  It spent many years abandoned. For the last century, it has been occupied by House Sokol and for a time served as their headquarters.  However, in the last few years, it has sat largely unused except by Igan Sokol, a scion of the Sokol merchant house who has been assigned there to oversee operations of the lighthouse. It is currently composed of a Mansion, and three Towers which sit upon the ruins of the old temple, and possibly darker ruins.


This adventure focuses heavily on two power groups within Phlan:

* The Black Fists - A local mercenary guild who works as the general guards and peacekeepers for the city of Phlan. They are generally competent, though not necessarily particularly a

The opening of the adventure is in the local tavern
