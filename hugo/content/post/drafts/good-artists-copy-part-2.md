In the [last article](good-artists-copy-part-1) I talked about the elements of the Expanse setting that I wanted to influnece my fantasy game.  One of the complications of this particular settings that is likely to cause some difficulty is the general background history of Earth, Mars, and the OPA, where Earth is ultimately (not more than a generation or three back) the source of all of the people inhabiting the other cultures.

In many fantasy worlds, the world is roughly steady state: There are a number of fantasy kingdoms and empires, but they've all been there for centuries, possibly millennia. The other trope that arises fairly often is around a rebelious country that is under the control of an oppressive country. However, the Expanse sets up a different sort of setting altogether. In the expanse, we see these three nations emerging into a geography that was empty before they arrived there.  It's hard to find such a space in a fantasy world, so that's our first real challenge. A few options present themselves: we could place this setting early in the history of the world, when humanity has yet to expand and cover the continent. Or maybe a more direct parallel to the Expanse - maybe the spells that enable travel to other planes in the multiverse (Plane Shift, Astral Projection, etc.) have only just been recently discovered, and humanity is in the process of expanding to nearby planes.

Immediately, this presents an interesting option. One of the big tropes of Fantasy is the "End of the World" plotline: An evil force gains some super-weapon that they plan to use to destroy or subjugate the "good" nations of the world. This is a time-honored formula (*cough* Tolkien *cough*), but can get pretty old pretty quickly. However, the Expanse setting provides another interesting option: instead of a super-weapon and an evil empire, you're involved in a rush to find and exploit new resources that weren't available yesterday. You're not racing against the evil empire, you're racing against the cloc on k, knowing that if you don't win the race, you'll be stuck in the cultural backwater, while the rest of the world rushes ahead.

I think the idea of a Multiverse just opening up sounds the most interesting, but it requires gutting some of the standard D&D Multiverse. D&D has (over the years) become an "and the Kitchen Sink" game system: there's a ton of stuff there and the thing that makes settings unique is more what they leave out than what they include. So, there are a few problems with building a D&D game around multi-planar exploration:

 1. Gods, fiends, and angels offer direct contact through a variety of spells and the Warlock class, and these all dwell on the outer planes.
 2. Elementals are closely linked to the inner "elemental" planes, and are understood to be "native" to those planes.
 3. Ghosts and "incorporeal" cretatures are closely linked to the Ethereal plane.
 4. A variety of spells and magical items allow people to easily access the various planes.

 This kind of campaign will require excising or hiding all of those elements of the game. This is something we're going to have to discuss with the other folks at the table, definitely during Session 0.

 What I'd propose is that the Gods, Angels and Demons all exist somewhere within what would be called the "Prime Material Plane" in a traditional game. We could have a "Mount Olympus" style physical location as a home for the gods. When the gods come down from heaven, they literally descend the mountain. And there's an underworld home of the dead that's part of the physical world in Greek mythology as well.  Of course this displaces the Cloud Giants' cloud castles, and the Drow's underdark too, which I don't mind leaving out of our game. This is already shaping up to be less about dungeon-delving and more about exploring other worlds, so we don't really lose anything by eliminating those aspects of D&D.

 This also poses another problem to our plane-hopping adventuring party: If a cleric's and warlock's spells come from their god or patron respectively, and that god or patron is literally present on their home plane, then what happens to the spells when the PCs leave the home plane? We could just eliminate those aspects of the game by restyling magic into "White Magic" for Clerics, "Grey Magic" for Wizards, and "Black Magic" for Warlocks.  That might be a really interesting idea to explore, but what if instead, Clerics and Warlocks took on a "missionary" role? If the deities and patrons were on board for this whole "colonizing othere planes" thing, and were actually actively interested in having their followers establish outposts on various planes as beach heads for their faith.

Honestly, most of these problems can be dealt with simply by elimininating the "transitory plane" aspect of the astral and ethereal
