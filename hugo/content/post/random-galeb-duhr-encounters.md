# 1d6 Galeb Duhr

![](/post/random-galeb-duhr-encounters/face-on-a-rock.jpg)

Here's a few options on how to flesh out the 1d6 Galeb Duhr from my
[Random Mountain Encounters](/post/random-mountain-encounters/). Instead of the
standard way of just counting how many of the creature to encounter, here's
a list of unique different types of the creature. You can roll on here
multiple times if you feel like it, or just go with a single roll.

Galeb Duhr are earth-aligned fae spirits, and often have alliances with fae
creatures in their region.

## 1) Sandstone

Sandstone is the softest of stones, a sedimentary stone that can be broken or
carved without even using tools. Galeb Duhr who are formed of sandstone are
often very young, but are also very cautious. Sandstone Galeb Duhr tend to
avoid most other sentient races as much as possible, due to the risk that
such people represent to them.

Sandstone tend to be very interested in working behind the scenes to build up
infrastructure and stable workings, because they're trying to make up for
their own inherent weaknesses. However, some very small number of Sandstone
Galeb Duhr decide that the best way to deal with their own weakness is to make
others weak. These deviants still tend towards working behind the scene, but
they do so towards coralling and containing the carbon-based life forms.

Instead of the ***Rolling Charge*** ability of standard Galeb Duhr, Sandstone
may have a variant ability:

***Sand Through the Hourglass.*** The Galeb Duhr can move through a space as
narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. It can also move through a hostile
creature's space, but cannot stop there.

## 2) Marble

Marble is a metamorphic form of Limestone, which means that they seem to feel
as if they are more "advanced" and "fancy" than other breeds. They tend to
think of themselves as the skilled artisans of the Galeb Duhr species. These
Galeb Duhr sometimes have an alternate ability to the standard ***Animate
Boulder*** ability that they can use at will:

***Reshape the Stone (Recharge 5-6).*** This ability acts as if the Galeb Duhr
casts the Stone Shape spell.

## 3) Gneiss

Gneiss is a metamorphic form of Granite, which is already one of the hardest
forms of stone. Gneiss Galeb Duhr consider themselves the solid base upon
which Galeb Duhr society is built, and are frequently leaders, in as much
as the Galeb Duhr have organized societies. If you're randomly rolling a
Gneiss, they should be in a group with at least 1d4 other Galeb Duhr.

Some Gneiss give up their ***Rolling Charge*** ability in exchange for a
+2 bonus to their natural armor class, and an additional 19 (3d8+15) hit
points.

## 4) Limestone

Limestone is an easily worked sedimentary stone, which is still solid
enough to be used architecturally. It is also the predominant mineral found
in caves and sinkholes. Limestone Galeb Duhr are very active, and work well
with humans, elves, dwarves and the other sentient races. While they tend
towards friendship with the "good" races, they frequently also enter into
alliances with Goblins, Kobolds, Lizardmen, Orcs, and other sentient species.

Limestone Galeb Duhr are "chatty" by Galeb Duhr standards, which doesn't
mean much by human standards, but a significant portion of Limestone
Galeb Duhr give up their ***Animate Boulder*** ability in exchange for an
alternate ability that they can use at will:

***Stone Tell.*** The Galeb Duhr gains the ability to speak with stones, which
can tell the Galeb Duhr details about who or what is touching the stone, who
or what has touched it recently, and what it might be covering, or on the
other side of the stone.

## 5) Basalt

Basalt is an igneous volcanic rock which makes up a large portion of the
earth's crust. While not as hard and unforgiving as Gneiss, Basalt is hard and
heavy, and acts as the warrior caste of the Galeb Duhr.

Basalt sometimes give up their ***Animate Boulder*** ability to instead master
an ability to raise a barrier of boulders about themselves.

***Boulder Barrier (1/day).*** The Galeb Duhr creates a swirling cloud of heavy
boulders surrounding itself in a circular wall. The wall lasts as long as the
Galeb Duhr concentrates, up to 10 minutes. It extends up to 20 feet high, and
5 feet thick. The wall provides three-quarters cover to the Galeb Duhr, and
makes the spaces surrounding it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the
wallâ€™s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the
creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
takes 6d10 bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as
much damage.

## 6) Pumice

Pumice are one of the few breeds of Galeb Duhr who can explore the surface of
the sea, and thus make up the "mariners" of Galeb Duhr society. Because the
denser Galeb Duhr can walk on the bottom of bodies of water, most Galeb Duhr
regard their Pumice relatives as flighty and fanciful.

Pumice Galeb Duhr are much faster on their feet than their more stolid
relatives. They have a normal speed of 30 ft. (45 ft. when rolling, 60 ft.
rolling downhill).
