I'm trying to come up with a way of thinking how the existence of various spells might affect the world around them for my [NaGaDeMon](/nagademon) project. Here's a first draft of my current thoughts.

Offensive/Defensive Spells
---
Spells like Magic Missile, Fireball, Acid Arrow, and even Shield and Mage Armor fall into a general category of "Warfare" spells in my mind. They change the face of conflict in fantastic ways. Since warfare is a constant concern of the human species, it makes sense for one or two of these spells to be of supreme importance, but having more than one of these types of spell doesn't have a *lot* more impact than having a single one, unless you want to go with an uneven distribution of magic. Maybe every army since the beginning of "modern" warfare has trained its soldiers in the use of Magic Missile, but one country has recently developed the ability to add Fireball to their combat repetiore, and so the world is tossed into imbalance, as one nation flexes its newfound military might.

Another option that could be interesting with multiple warfare spells would be different nations using different tactics... Perhaps your Prussian analogue uses Magic Missile exclusively, but your English analogue uses Acid Arrow. Shorter range, more devestating, and possibly leaves behind polution and damage to the land. These engender two different military disciplines, which can be fascinating to explore. Likewise, if one country has Prismatic sphere, and the other has Fireball, then it's likely that their distinctive fighting styles will be different.
