Well, we had a character death, and met the Xanathar, though not directly related.  Always fun.

It started off with Erik Tealeaf deciding that he wanted to get in touch with Xanathar and ask if he had any fellow Beholders he'd like killed, to help them obtain a beholder's central eye for the Demon Lord summoning ritual. In order to do so, he first got in touch with Amaghero, the Horned Dwarf in Skullport, looking for an introduction.

Amaghero suggested that if Erik were to potentially help him with a problem, he could recommend him to Xanathar. Amaghero suggested that there was an orc by the name of Grimjaw who was undercutting him by bringing in this horde of cheap, subservient drow slaves.
