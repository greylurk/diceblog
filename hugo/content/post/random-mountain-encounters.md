I'm currently running [The Moon is a Mirror](http://blog.trilemma.com/2017/02/the-moon-is-mirror.html)
from Trilemma design, and having a great old time with it, but I'm adding some
old-school hex crawl around the area. This uses the 2e standard of rolling
1d8+1d12 to generate an encounter.  The advantage of this method is that it
gives you a nicely centered [distribution](http://anydice.com/program/17d4)
that allows you to put less common encounters on the outer edges (2-3, 19-20)
and more common encounters in the center (9-13). There's more detail in the 2d
Dungeon Master's Guide, but the basics are that you make a check several times
per day (depending on terrain) by rolling a d10. Each terrain has a likelyhood
of encounter, and if you roll below that number, you then roll on the
encounter table for that terrain type to determine what the party encounters.

This is a bit convoluted, but the end result is that in the mountains, three
times per day I roll a d10. If I get less than a 3, then I roll 1d8+1d12 and
I've got a random encounter to run the players through.

Like all Random Encounter tables, I'm generally using these as "writing
prompts" to come up with something interesting.  For example, if I roll a
result of "Dwarven Guards", the encounter might just be a group of dwarves
guarding a caravan, or it might be a dwarven outpost along the route, or it
might be an all-dwarven adventuring party returning from a nearby dungeon,
with loads of loot, and a corpse of their comrade.

Random Encounters are seeds for stories.
