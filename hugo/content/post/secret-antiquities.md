Today I just happened across [Secret Antiquities][1], Which appears to be a 
zine about running [Dungeon Crawl Classics][2] set in America, with High
Weirdness added into the mix. Kind of an "Unknown Armies" meets "Werewolf the
Apocalypse". While my feelings on Dungeon Crawl Classics are kind of mixed,
I have a copy of it, and modern games with alternate occult history are a
special sort of wonderful for me.


I'll definitely be picking this up from Lulu.
