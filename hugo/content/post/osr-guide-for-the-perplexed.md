Answering [Zak Smith's](http://dndwithpornstars.blogspot.com/2018/10/osr-guide-for-perplexed-questionnaire.html) OSR guide for the Perplexed questionaire. 

1. **One article or blog entry that best exemplifies the OSR**
    Too many to list, but my current jam is [Mazes: The Monotony  or how to run an actual maze](https://graphiteprime.blogspot.com/2018/10/mazes-monotony-or-how-to-run-actual-maze.html). A few features stand out about it that makes it OSR to me: First, it recognizes an aspect of gaming that is boring and offers a solution to reconcile that boredom. It offers a simple house rule with minimal game stats as a solution, and then builds a whole adventure using random tables and even a save or die trap or two.

2. **My favorite piece of OSR wisdom/advice/snark:**
    "Draw maps, leave empty spaces" - Technically this is from Dungeon World, which might not strictly be OSR if you ask some people, but the idea that a more loosely defined world is more conducive to fun is definitely an OSR position.

3. **Best OSR module/supplement:**
    [The Age of Undying](http://www.rpgnow.com/product/181087/The-Age-of-Undying-DCC) is a fun little DCC supplement that showcases the gonzo nature of DCC.

4. **My favorite house rule (by someone else):**
    It's not exactly a house rule, but ACKS's expansion on the Race as class rules, where the "Elf" class becomes a special class that only elves can take.

5. **How I found out about the OSR:**
    In 2013, Wizards of the Coast gave away PDF copies of the Temple of Elemental Evil as a Halloween special on Dndclassics.com. I pulled out my 1e PHB and DMG, and started looking for character sheets online. I happened across the Dragonsfoot forums, and the rest is history.

6. **My favorite OSR online resource/toy:**
    [Donjon](https://donjon.bin.sh/) has a bunch of fun random generators.

7. **Best place to talk to other OSR gamers:**
    Frog God Games' Discord and [MeWe's OSR Group](https://mewe.com/group/5b2d9a2ba40f3016e7b6b2ab) are the primary two places I check out these days.

8. **Other places I might be found hanging out talking games:**
    Google Plus, and I have a bad Facebook habit.

9. **My awesome, pithy OSR take nobody appreciates enough:**
    The OSR and the Storygame movement are actually addressing the same problems. Storygamers and OSR folks have more in common with eachother than the average Pathfinder Society gamer.

10. **My favorite non-OSR RPG:**
	I'm enjoying Fate Core for its simplicity.

11. **Why I like OSR stuff:**
	It's a combination of nostalgia, and a distaste for the overly complicated and "rules as physics" aspects of 3e and later.

12. **Two other cool OSR things you should know about that I havenâ€™t named yet:**
	I'm a pretty big fan of Swords and Sorcery Complete. It's got the charm of B/X, but the polish of some of the newer editions.

13. **If I could read but one other RPG blog but my own it would be:**
	[Swords and Stitchery](https://swordsandstitchery.blogspot.com) has a ton of great random tables.

14. **A game thing I made that I like quite a lot is:**
	I wrote up a one page simpliefied summary of Combat for OSRIC and AD&D 1e.

15. **I'm currently running/playing:**
    I'm currently running a 5e campaign in it's 4th year, and playing Blades in the Dark, and I've just started a Shadowrun game as a player.

16. **I don't care whether you use ascending or descending AC because:**
    I'm not a math hipster.

17. **The OSRest picture I could post on short notice:**
