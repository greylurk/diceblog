I'm constantly accumulating things that I *want* to do in gaming, but I almost
never actually accomplish them. Sure, I get some things done, but usually it's 
the low-hanging fruit, and I feel like I need a place to write them down, and
actually make some progress on them.

So, here, in no particular order is the stuff I want to do in 2017:

## Start a gaming blog 

I've been planning on launching a gaming blog for a few years now, and I
haven't managed to actually get it off the ground. I'm hoping to get at *least* two major updates a week. 

## Publish a Gaming PDF 

With the launch of the [DM's Guild](http://www.dmsguild.com/browse.php?affiliate_id=6913) and the similar storefronts for Cypher System and Unknown Armies, and the like, there's a big opportunity for self-publishing some gaiming accessories. I'd like to get something out on OneBookShelf or one of their competitors in order to see if I can do it. 

## Run a few of my "backlog" games

Hello, my name is Adam, and I'm a Kickstarter Junkie. In the last few years, I've kickstarted at least a dozen new RPGs that I have yet to even run a single game of:

* [Monsterhearts 2](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/averyalder/monsterhearts-2)
* [Bluebeard's Bride](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1921129910/bluebeards-bride)

* [Pitfalls and Penguins](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joehills/pitfalls-and-penguins-first-printing)

That's a lot of games, and I haven't played any of them. I've *read* most of them, and pulled ideas from them into the other games I'm running, but I haven't run or played in any of them as written. That sucks. I really want to start chipping away at the list of un-played games this year.
